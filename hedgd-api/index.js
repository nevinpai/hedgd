      Generate 100 questions based on current geopolitical and financial events to assess a personâ€™s investment worldview. 
      The questions need to be topical and relevant to the current events, like polymarket odds betting questions on 
      politics, tech, finance, etc. Ensure the questions use the most up to date information possible and fact check things like
      dates and stock prices to ensure they are accurate and up to date as this is imperative. Example questions (not necissarily up to date):
      "Will the US send foreign aid to Ukraine by the end of June"
      "Will Bitcoin be above $200,000 by the end of the year"
      "Will the Trump administration collapse by the end of the year"
      "Will the Russian ruble rebound by the end of the year"
      The questions should be suitable for a Tinder-style swipe interface (yes/no answers).

      ["Do you prioritize long-term growth over short-term gains?", "Are you comfortable with volatile markets?"]
